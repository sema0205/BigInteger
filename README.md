# BigInteger

A user-defined type for an unsigned integer of fixed length **uint2022_t** is implemented. The size of the resulting type does not exceed 300 bytes.

The following set of functions and operators is implemented for the above-mentioned type:

     1. Conversion from uint32_t
     2. Conversion from a string
     3. Addition
     4. Subtraction
     5. Multiplication
     6. Output to console
     7. Comparison (== and !=)


### Tests

The project contains a basic set of tests that will ensure that the implementation of functions is carried out without explicit errors.
